# Interview Templates Vault (ITV)

This is a shared repository that can be used to create and share scenarios for interviews.

## Problem description

Sometimes interviews are fun and eventful for both the candidate and the interviewer, sometimes it's not. ITV tries to solve this problem by providing a set of templates with close to real world problems that can be interesting to walk through an interview.

Some scenarios can be aimed at checking hard skills at a entry/medium level, some can test candidates overall problem solving skills and design insight.

Feel free to PR your templates.
